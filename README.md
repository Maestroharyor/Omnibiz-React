The features and functionalities are as stated in the document.

## Folder/File Structure

The project follows the standard structure of a react project except with the addition of four new folders in the __SRC__ directory:
* __COMPONENTS:__ This contains all the components used (with 3 subfolders): 
  * __ELEMENTS__
  * __FORMS__
  * __LAYOUTS__
* __CONTEXT:__ This contains the context states used in the project.
* __FUNCTIONS:__ This contains any JavaScript function used in project.
* __STYLES:__ Stylesheet directory for the project.

## CSS Styling
The project was styled using regular CSS files located in the __STYLES__ folder in the __SRC__ directory.
The approach followed is a mobile-first responsive design with the following breakpoints:

```css

/* Small devices (landscape phones, 640px and up) */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
}

/* Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
}

/* Large devices (desktops, 1024px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
}

/* XL-Large devices (large desktops, 1280px and up) */
